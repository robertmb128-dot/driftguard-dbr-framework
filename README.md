# DriftGuard-DBR Framework

## Project Intent

This project establishes a standardized, engine-agnostic Database Reliability and Security Control Framework.

### Purpose
- Define authoritative baseline controls for database environments
- Detect configuration drift against versioned policy baselines
- Classify risk severity and operational impact
- Provide measurable compliance scoring
- Enable controlled remediation workflows
- Normalize standards across development, staging, and production environments

### Framework Characteristics
- Engine agnostic at the control definition layer
- Adapter-based for engine-specific validation
- Version-controlled and auditable
- Designed for measurable governance and reliability posture tracking

### Evolution
This project represents the formal evolution of DriftGuard from a detection utility into a structured reliability governance system.
